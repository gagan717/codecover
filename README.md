How to set developer environment to modify this project
--------------------------------------------------------

### Contents of the Github project
This project has 3 folders respectively :

plugin : Codelearn Android plugin project and its generated JAR

project: Codelearns Android projects like twitter project and their generated ZIPs

tests: Codelearn Android tests for projects like twitter project and generated JARs

Note: For working on these projects, copy contents of dropin-dependencies to your ECLIPSE dropins folder. Import all three projects in Eclipse workspace. Make sure your ECLIPSE_HOME variable is set, otherwise set it or change Build path to include jars from dropins folder of eclipse.


### Requirements : Eclipse comes with Plugin development environment packaged with it. You can check by going to File->New->Other->Plugin development category exists. Else download PDE plugin for eclipse by following steps in this blog: http://blog.ankursharma.org/2009/08/how-do-i-install-pde_20.html

1) Import all 3 projects into eclipse workspace

2) Set your ECLIPSE_HOME to point to eclipse directory

{Note: Goto Eclipse Preferences ->Java->Build Path-> Classpath vatiables and create a new variable ECLIPSE_HOME specifying the location of directory from where Eclipse has been launched.}


3) To modify tests, edit in SampleTests.java

4) To execute these modifications, goto RunTests.java and and click on Run (or Run as->Run as Java Application).

5) Generate jar as Export -> Export as Jar and save it in respective JARS folder

6)  Project folder must contain an android project called twit. 

PLEASE NOTE NAME AND POSITION OF THIS PROJECT IS ESSENTIAL FOR TESTS TO RUN. IF YOU WANT TO TRY ANY OTHER ANDROID PROJECT, KEEP THIS PROJECT NAME SAME AND REPLACE THE JAVA FILES WITH YOURS BUT KEEPING NAMES PRESERVED (Otherwise, changes will be reqd in tests as well as plugin project)

7) For plugin project, Export->Export as Plugins and Fragments and save it in respective JARS folder.


Twit-test project has RunTest.java which can be called to test TESTS.

ALL JARS MUST BE SAVED TO RESPECTIVE JARS FOLDERS. JAR FILES FROM THESE FOLDERS ARE COPIED TO DROPIN-DEPENDENCIES FOLDER.

### Deployment

Copy plugin's jar from its respective JARS folder, copy zip of android from its respective JARS folder, copy jar of tests from its respective JARS folder

Paste in dropin-dependencies, replacing old copies.

Create a dropin-dependencies zip to be given to users.
